Codefreeze is a conference for programmers by programmers. Actually, it's not a conference at all. But something like that. We would like to have likeminded people to gather in one place and have long conversations about codecraftmanship over a beer. Did we mention that this place is above the arctic circle? Which is pretty cool. Or freezingly cold actually.
